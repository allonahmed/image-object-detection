# Detecting clothing objects in images

### Project Details: 
For this project, we want to be able to detech clothing types from an image such as shirts and pants. This will help in grouping clothing into categories for organizing a database involving that contains images of clothes. Further down the line we will need to also distinguish different parts of clothing, for example, in a sneaker, we would want to identify the toebox or tongue and create new images of the item.

### Example using ImageAI:
